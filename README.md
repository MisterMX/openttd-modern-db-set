## Push-pull Configuration

This train set allows push-pull configuration for trains with a locomotive at one end, and a control car at the other. If the train's direction is reversed, the locomotive will stay at its position and *push* the rest of the train instead of pulling it. This only works with a single locomotive and only with coaches and locomotives from this train set.
